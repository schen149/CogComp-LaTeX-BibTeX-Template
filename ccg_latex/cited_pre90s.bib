% The file contains the Cognitive Computation Group Cited papers from before 1990
%
%
% The key for an entry should be the concatenation of:
%   (1) The full last name of the first author (first letter capitalized),
%   (2) The first two characters of the last name of each following author (first letter capitalized),
%   (3) The last two digits of the year of the publication, and
%   (4) [Optional] A letter from "bcdefg..." or other text (e.g. volume number) if necessary to yield unique keys.
%
% Example: AhoHoUl74
%
% The entries in this file should be alphabetically sorted by key value.
%
% Entries with more than 3 authors should replace (1) and (2) with
% the first letter of each author's last name, capitalized.
