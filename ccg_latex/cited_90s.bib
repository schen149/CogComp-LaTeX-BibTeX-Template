% The file contains the Cognitive Computation Group Cited papers from 1990-1994
%
%
% The key for an entry should be the concatenation of:
%   (1) The full last name of the first author (first letter capitalized),
%   (2) The first two characters of the last name of each following author (first letter capitalized),
%   (3) The last two digits of the year of the publication, and
%   (4) [Optional] A letter from "bcdefg..." or other text (e.g. volume number) if necessary to yield unique keys.
%
% Example: AhoHoUl74
%
% The entries in this file should be alphabetically sorted by key value.
%
% Entries with more than 3 authors should replace (1) and (2) with
% the first letter of each author's last name, capitalized.

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally, semantic information in computational lexicons is limited to notions such as selectional restrictions or domain-specific constraints, encoded in a ''static'' representation. This information is typically used in natural language processing by a simple knowledge manipulation mechanism limited to the ability to match valences of structurally related words. The most advanced device for imposing structure on lexical information is that of inheritance, both at the object (lexical items) and meta (lexical concepts) levels of lexicon. In this paper we argue that this is an impoverished view of a computational lexicon and that, for all its advantages, simple inheritance lacks the descriptive power necessary for characterizing fine-grained distinctions in the lexical semantics of words. We describe a theory of lexical semantics making use of a knowledge representation framework that offers a richer, more expressive vocabulary for lexical information. In particular, by performing specialized inference over the ways in which aspects of knowledge structures of words in context can be composed, mutually compatible and contextually relevant lexical components of words and phrases are highlighted. We discuss the relevance of this view of the lexicon, as an explanatory device accounting for language creativity, as well as a mechanism underlying the implementation of open-ended natural language processing systems. In particular, we demonstrate how lexical ambiguity resolution-now an integral part of the same procedure that creates the semantic interpretation of a sentence itself-becomes a process not of selecting from a pre-determined set of senses, but of highlighting certain lexical properties brought forth by, and relevant to, the current context.},

  Abstract                 = {Supervised Learning in Multi-Layered Neural Networks
(MLNs) has been recently proposed through the
well-known Backpropagation algorithm. This is a
gradient method which can get stuck in local minima,
as simple examples can show. In this paper, some
conditions on the network architecture and the
learning environment are proposed which ensure the
convergence of the Backpropagation algorithm. It is
proven in particular that the convergence holds if
the classes are linearly-separable. In this case,
the experience gained in several experiments shows
that $MLNs$ exceed perceptrons in generalization to
new examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method for calculating lower bounds on the space required and local ambiguities entailed by parsing strategies. A fast, compact natural language parser must implement a strategy with low space requirements and few local ambiguities. It is also widely assumed in the psycholinguistics literature that extremely limited short-term space is available to the human parser, and that sentences containing center-embedded constructions are incomprehensible because processing them requires more space than is available. However, we show that the parsing strategies most psycholinguists assume require less space for processing center-embedded constructions than for processing other perfectly comprehensible constructions. We present alternative strategies for which center-embedded constructions do require more space than other constructions.},
