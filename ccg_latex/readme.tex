When drafting your paper, we recommend using the following .bib files to manage your citations. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{ccg.bib} contains all publications from our group to date.
    \item \texttt{cited.bib} contains (almost) all citations we have made in our publications. 
%    \item \texttt{new.bib} should contain all new citations you make in your paper, if not already in \emph{cited.bib}. 
    % \item (optional) \texttt{anthology.bib} includes every paper in ACL anthology to date. This is taken from the ACL latex template.
\end{enumerate}

If you need to include a new bibitem that is not in any of these, please add it to cited.bib, but {\bf only after your change the style of the bib item to the ccg.bib style}

Changing the style mostly requires you to change the bibitem key. If you are not sure what the key style is, please consult the instructions at the top of the ccg.bib file.


%\textbf{After your paper gets published:} 
%Please merge your \texttt{new.bib} to \texttt{cited.bib}, by following steps specified in \href{https://github.com/CogComp/ccg-bibfiles}{\color{blue} github.com/CogComp/ccg-bibfiles}.  \\\\
